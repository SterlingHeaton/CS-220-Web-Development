        <p>Hello, my name is Sterling!</p>
        <p>I'm a passionate developer expanding my knowledge in languages, concepts, and experience. I make sure to output the best work I can while being efficient with my time. Through numerous personal projects and opportunities to develop through the internet has given me knowledge and experiences I'll never forget.

Being presented with problems that require knowledge I don't have is very intriguing and I'm always wanting to dig deeper into my skillset. Quickly being able to learn the unknown and apply my newly acquired knowledge is a key aspect of my inspiration to come up with a solution.

I have developed multiple plugins for Minecraft servers help with moderation, tracking progression on projects, and quality of life updates for the player base. I have also helped design a MySQL database to help track player information and track different information in my other personal projects. Lastly, I have developed a chrome extension for one of my friends to automate the process of entering data.

I am proficient in: Java, SQL queries, and basic website design.
I can understand and write: Javascript, Python, and C#.</p>

        <h3 style="color:#ed2939">Brandon</h3>
        <p>Hello, my name is Brandon! I enjoy reading epic fantasy series, video games, passing a ball with my son and watching "New Girl" with my wife. Jrr Tolkein is one of my favorite authors from my childhood but another successor in my opinion is Brandon Sanderson. He opens a whole new concept to magic and bringing complex livelyhoods into his stories. My wife has always loved dance and will try to get me to bust out my 'moves' that I clearly don't own! We have a fun time with our two little boys and since our last baby is only 2 months old I don't get to do much with him yet but it is simply fun to hold and watch him. I am so grateful for my family and the support my wife gives me trying to learn in school and life.
