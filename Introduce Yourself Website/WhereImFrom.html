                <p style="float:left">I am from Midvale, Utah, and I have been here for almost my whole life. I have a
                    single sibling, an older sister, and my mom and dad. I've grown up with cats, and we currently have
                    one princess named Sox (because she likes to drag my dad's socks around the house). My sister also
                    has a small dog named Darsha; she was a rescue that is also my sister's therapy dog. I attended
                    Midvale Elementary, Midvale Middle, and Hillcrest High before coming to Ensign. I moved up
                    to Bountiful in 2017 and then Centerville a year later, with some friends, before moving back to
                    Midvale at the start of the pandemic. </p>
