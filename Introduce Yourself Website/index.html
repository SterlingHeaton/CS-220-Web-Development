            <hr>
            <p>Hello, my name is Sterling Heaton.</p>

            <h2>School</h2>
            <p>I am currently studying at Ensign College and working towards my Associate of Science with a Certificate
                in Computer Science. I have worked with HTML, CSS, and Javascript before and look forward to learning
                more about designing websites. I am relatively proficient in Java and have learned a lot on my own from
                coding plugins for Minecraft servers. I am currently searching for software development internships and
                hopefully starting one early to mid-next year.</p>

            <h2>Free Time</h2>
            <div id="textWithContent">
                <p style="float: left">Besides programming, I like to play games and watch movies with my friends. I
                    mostly like to play
                    competitive games like League Of Legends, VALORANT, and Apex Legends. Still, I'll usually go back to
                    sandbox games like Minecraft or Terraria a few times a year. As for movies, my friends and I will
                    try to
                    have a movie night over Discord a couple of times a month. I always enjoy horror/thriller movies,
                    but we
                    will usually watch a comedy or action movie.</p>
